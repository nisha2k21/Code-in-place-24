Baby Snake Game Project 

This project aims to create a simplified version of the classic Snake game. Our version, "Baby Snake," will feature a basic game world with a player and a goal. The player, represented by a blue square, starts in the top left corner, while the goal, represented by a red square, is placed at coordinates that are multiples of 20.  **Milestone #1: Set Up the World**  In this milestone, we will:  
1. # Initialize the Game Environment#:  Set up the game window using a graphical library.
2. # Draw the Game Elements#: Create a 400x400 pixel window where a 20x20 pixel blue square (player) starts at (0, 0) and a 20x20 pixel red square (goal) is positioned at (360, 360).
      
This basic setup will serve as the foundation for building additional game features in subsequent milestones.
